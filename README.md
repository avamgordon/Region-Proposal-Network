# Region-Proposal-Network
Programming project completed for CSE 5524 (Computer Vision) using Python 3 to implement a Region Proposal Network (RPN) using bounding boxes and COCO-style annotations.  

The RPN pipeline is implemented using ground truth tensor generation, decoding patch-based proposals, anchor-based encoding and decoding, and non-maximum suppression. 

The main Python libraries used in this project are numpy, pillow, and matplotlib.
